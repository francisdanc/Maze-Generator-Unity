# Maze-Generator-Unity
A procedural maze generator for the unity game engine

This is my second procedural generation project i've made in unity. I recently became interested in generating mazes after reading about several algorithms to do so.
I decided I was up for the challenge and decided that out of all the algorithms the Hunt and Kill algorithm was the one i'd attempt to create as 
it was an algorithm with zero bias, meaning there is no pattern to the generation. This project was very difficult and the final version took me around
four days to complete. The script takes in a cellsize and a mapsize algorithm as well as a floor and wall object. These objects do not need to be made 
to any specific size simply create a cube prefab with the desired materials and then the script creates the walls and floors automatically.
